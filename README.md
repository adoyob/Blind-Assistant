# Blind-Assistant
Blind Assistant is an android application for blind or visually impaired people. Here we proposed a system that is actually a virtual assistant for a blind user. This application’s GUI (Graphical User Interface) is voice-operated which is much easier to handle for blind people. In our application, a blind user can know time and date information, his exact location and weather information. User can use dictionary which is also voice-operated and artificial intelligence based that can translate much better even in a full sentence. Detecting objects is the most significant part of our project. Object detection helps blind user to know about their current environment. Some other valuable features are also added in this application. Face Recognition, Bangla Money Recognition, Text message control, Online News. With Face recognition feature, user can store face data of relatives and system will predict faces while object detection feature detects person. Bangla money will be recognized by this system also. Blind user can read text messages. Recent Bangla news will be provided by this system.
